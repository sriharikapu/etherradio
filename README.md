Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
EtherRadio is a streaming platform that prioritizes artist incomes over the platform's profits. Our platform not only offers an affordable streaming service for music lovers but it also ensures that artists are paid fairly. EtherRadio strives to optimize the experience for listeners and musicians.

Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
Our team used solidity, javascript, CSS3,HTML5,JQuery, Bootstrap. We also used the Portis SDK because we found it to be better than metamask.
